# Welcome {-}

This book provides an introduction to advanced analytics with R using the modeling packages called [tidymodels](https://tidymodels.org) to build, evaluate, compare, and tune predictive models. 

Weâ€™ll cover key concepts in statistical learning and machine learning including overfitting, the holdout method, the bias-variance trade-off, ensembling, cross-validation, and feature engineering.
