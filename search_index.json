In this chapter you will learn how to specify a regression model with the tidymodels package. To use the code in this article, you will need to install the following packages: tidyverse tidymodels skimr GGally ggmap library(tidyverse) library(tidymodels) library(skimr) library(GGally) library(ggmap) In this example, our goal is to build a model of housing prices in California. In particular, the model should learn from California census data and be able to predict the median house price in any district (population of 600 to 3000 people), given some predictor variables. We use the root mean square error (RMSE) as a performance measure for our regression problem. 1.1 Data understanding In Data Understanding, you will learn how to: Import data Get an overview about the data structure Split data into training and test set using stratified sampling Discover and visualize the data to gain insights 1.1.1 Imort Data First of all, let’s import the data: LINK &lt;- &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/master/housing.csv&quot; housing &lt;- read_csv(LINK) 1.1.2 Data overview Next, we take a look at the data structure: California census top 4 rows of the DataFrame: head(housing, 4) Data info: glimpse(housing) Data summary of numerical and categorical attributes using a function from the package skimr: skim(housing) Count levels of our categorical variable: housing %&gt;% count(ocean_proximity, sort = TRUE ) The function ggscatmat from the package GGally creates a matrix with scatterplots, densities and correlations for numeric columns. In our code, we enter the dataset housing, an color column for our categorical variable ocean_proximity, and an alpha level of 0.8 (for transparency). ggscatmat(housing, color = &quot;ocean_proximity&quot;, alpha = 0.8) To obtain an overview of even more visualizations, we can use the function ggpairs: ggpairs(housing) 1.1.3 Data splitting Let’s assume we would know that the median income is a very important attribute to predict median housing prices. Therefore, we would want to create a training and test set using stratified sampling. A stratum (plural strata) refers to a subset (part) of the population (entire collection of items under consideration) which is being sampled. Take a look at ?? housing %&gt;% ggplot(aes(median_income)) + geom_histogram(bins = 30) We want to ensure that the test set is representative of the the various categories of incomes in the whole dataset. In other words, we would like to have instances for each stratum, or else the stimate of a strtum’s importance may be biased. This means that you should not have too many starta, and each stratum should be large enough. We use 5 strata in our example. set.seed(42) new_split &lt;- initial_split(housing, prop = 3 / 4, strata = median_income, breaks = 5 ) new_train &lt;- training(new_split) new_test &lt;- testing(new_split) 1.1.4 Data exploration A Geographical scatterplot of the data: housing %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) + geom_point(color = &quot;cornflowerblue&quot;) A better visualization that highlights high-density areas: housing %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) + geom_point(color = &quot;cornflowerblue&quot;, alpha = 0.1) California housing prices: red is expensive, purple is cheap and larger circles indicate areas with a larger population. housing %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) + geom_point(aes(size = population, color = median_house_value), alpha = 0.4 ) + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(rainbow(4))) library(ggmap) qmplot( x = longitude, y = latitude, data = housing, geom = &quot;point&quot;, color = median_house_value, size = population, alpha = 0.4 ) + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(rainbow(4))) 1.2 Model type Pick an model type: choose from this list Set the engine: choose from this list Set the mode: regression or classification library(tidymodels) lm_spec &lt;- # your model specification linear_reg() %&gt;% # model type set_engine(engine = &quot;lm&quot;) %&gt;% # model engine set_mode(&quot;regression&quot;) # model mode # Show your model specification lm_spec 1.3 Model training In the training process, you run an algorithm on data and thereby produce a model.

Note that this process is usually used to compare the performance of multiple models and to tune hyperparameters. In this tutorial however, we only want to demonstrate the process and therefore only use one model. We can build a set of k-Fold cross validation sets and use this set of resamples to estimate the performance of our model using the fit_resamples() function. Note that this function does not do any tuning of the model parameters. The function is only used for computing performance metrics across some set of resamples. It will fit our model lm_spec to each resample and evaluate on the heldout set from each resample. It is important to note, that the function does not even keep the models it trains. First of all, we build a set of 10 validation folds with the function vfold_cv (we also use stratified sampling in this example): set.seed(100) cv_folds &lt;- vfold_cv(new_train, v = 10, strata = Sale_Price, breaks = 4 ) cv_folds Next, let’s fit the model on each of the 10 folds with fit_resamples() and store the results as lm_res: lm_res &lt;- lm_spec %&gt;% fit_resamples( Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, resamples = cv_folds ) Now we can collect the performance metrics with collect_metrics().

Recipes are built as a series of preprocessing steps, such as: converting qualitative predictors to indicator variables (also known as dummy variables), transforming data to be on a different scale (e.g., taking the logarithm of a variable), transforming whole groups of predictors together, extracting key features from raw variables (e.g., getting the day of the week out of a date variable), and so on. If you are familiar with R’s formula interface, a lot of this might sound familiar and like what a formula already does. Recipes can be used to do many of the same things, but they have a much wider range of possibilities. This article shows how to use recipes for modeling. In summary, the idea of the recipes package is to define a recipe or blueprint that can be used to sequentially define the encodings and preprocessing of the data (i.e. “feature engineering”) before we build our models.

First, we must tell the recipe() what our model is going to be (using a formula here) and what our training data is. step_novel() will convert all nominal variables to factors. We then convert the factor columns into (one or more) numeric binary (0 and 1) variables for the levels of the training data. We remove any numeric variables that have zero variance.

When we juice() the recipe, we squeeze that training data back out, transformed in the ways we specified: juice(ames_prep) The prepped recipe ames_prep contains all our transformations for data preprocessing and feature engineering, as well as the data these transformations were estimated from. 9.4 bake() We now can simply apply all of the recipe transformations to the testing data. The function to perform this is called bake(): test_trans &lt;- bake(ames_prep, new_data = new_test) Now it’s time to specify and then fit our models.

This data set contains information on 325,819 flights departing near New York City in 2013. Furthermore, it contains weather data (hourly meterological data for LGA, JFK and EWR). Let’s start by loading the data and making a few changes to the variables: flight_data_all &lt;- flights %&gt;% mutate( # Convert the arrival delay to a factor arr_delay = ifelse(arr_delay &gt;= 30, &quot;late&quot;, &quot;on_time&quot; ), arr_delay = factor(arr_delay), # We will use the date (not date-time) # in the recipe below date = as.Date(time_hour) ) %&gt;% # Include weather data inner_join(weather, by = c(&quot;origin&quot;, &quot;time_hour&quot;)) %&gt;% # Only retain the specific columns we will use select( dep_time, flight, origin, dest, air_time, distance, carrier, date, arr_delay, time_hour ) %&gt;% # Exclude missing data na.omit() %&gt;% # For creating models, it is # better to have qualitative columns # encoded as factors (instead of character strings) mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor)) To speed up later calculations we only use a sample of the data: set.seed(123) flight_data &lt;- sample_n( flight_data_all, 10000 ) We can see that around 16% of the flights in this data set arrived more than 30 minutes late: flight_data %&gt;% count(arr_delay) %&gt;% mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) 13.1 Data overview Before we start building up our recipe, let’s take a quick look at a few specific variables that will be important for both preprocessing and modeling. First, notice that the variable we created called arr_delay is a factor variable; it is important that our outcome variable for training a classification model (at least a logistic regression model) is numeric. glimpse(flight_data) Second, there are two variables that we don’t want to use as predictors in our model, but that we would like to retain as identification variables that can be used to troubleshoot poorly predicted data points. These are flight, a numeric value, and time_hour, a date-time value. Third, there are 79 flight destinations contained in dest and 14 distinct carriers. flight_data %&gt;% skimr::skim(dest, carrier) Because we’ll be using a logistic regression model in this tutorial, the variables dest and carrier will be converted to dummy variables. However, some of these values do not occur very frequently and this could complicate our analysis. We’ll discuss specific steps later in this tutorial that we can add to our recipe to address this issue before modeling. "],["data-splitting-2.html", "Chapter 14 Data splitting", " Chapter 14 Data splitting To get started, let’s split this single dataset into two: a training set and a testing set. We’ll keep most of the rows in the original dataset (subset chosen randomly) in the training set. The training data will be used to fit the model, and the testing set will be used to measure model performance. To do this, we can use the rsample package (included in tidymodels) to create an object that contains the information on how to split the data, and then two more rsample functions to create data frames for the training and testing sets: # Fix the random numbers by setting the seed # This enables the analysis to be reproducible # when random numbers are used set.seed(555) # Put 3/4 of the data into the training set data_split &lt;- initial_split(flight_data, prop = 3 / 4 ) # Create data frames for the two sets: train_data &lt;- training(data_split) test_data &lt;- testing(data_split) "],["create-recipe-and-roles.html", "Chapter 15 Create recipe and roles 15.1 Create features", " Chapter 15 Create recipe and roles To get started, let’s create a recipe for a classification model. Before training the models, we can use a recipe to create a few new predictors and conduct some preprocessing required by the model. The recipe() function has two arguments: A formula. Any variable on the left-hand side of the tilde (~) is considered the model outcome (here, arr_delay). On the right-hand side of the tilde are the predictors. Variables may be listed by name, or you can use the dot (.) to indicate all other variables as predictors. The data. A recipe is associated with the data set used to create the model. This will typically be the training set, so data = train_data here. Naming a data set doesn’t actually change the data itself; it is only used to catalog the names of the variables and their types, like factors, integers, dates, etc. We can also add roles to this recipe. We can use the update_role() function to let recipes know that flight and time_hour are variables with a custom role that we call “ID” (a role can have any character value). Whereas our formula included all variables in the training set other than arr_delay as predictors, this tells the recipe to keep these two variables but not use them as either outcomes or predictors. flights_rec &lt;- recipe(arr_delay ~ ., data = train_data) %&gt;% update_role(flight, time_hour, new_role = &quot;ID&quot; ) This step of adding roles to a recipe is optional; the purpose of using it here is that those two variables can be retained in the data but not included in the model. This can be convenient when, after the model is fit, we want to investigate some poorly predicted value. These ID columns will be available and can be used to try to understand what went wrong. To get the current set of variables and roles, use the summary() function: summary(flights_rec) 15.1 Create features Now we can start adding steps onto our recipe using the pipe operator. 15.1.1 Date Perhaps it is reasonable for the date of the flight to have an effect on the likelihood of a late arrival. A little bit of feature engineering might go a long way to improving our model. How should the date be encoded into the model? The date column has an R date object so including that column “as is” will mean that the model will convert it to a numeric format equal to the number of days after a reference date: flight_data %&gt;% distinct(date) %&gt;% mutate(numeric_date = as.numeric(date)) It’s possible that the numeric date variable is a good option for modeling. However, it might be better to add model terms derived from the date that have a better potential to be important to the model. For example, we could derive the following meaningful features from the single date variable: the day of the week, the month, and whether or not the date corresponds to a holiday. Let’s do all three of these by adding steps to our recipe: flights_rec &lt;- recipe(arr_delay ~ ., data = train_data ) %&gt;% update_role(flight, time_hour, new_role = &quot;ID&quot; ) %&gt;% step_date(date, features = c(&quot;dow&quot;, &quot;month&quot;) ) %&gt;% step_holiday(date, holidays = timeDate::listHolidays(&quot;US&quot;) ) %&gt;% step_rm(date) What do each of these steps do? With step_date(), we created two new factor columns with the appropriate day of the week (dow) and the month. With step_holiday(), we created a binary variable indicating whether the current date is a holiday or not. The argument value of timeDate::listHolidays(\"US\") uses the timeDate package to list the 17 standard US holidays. With step_rm(), we remove the original date variable since we no longer want it in the model. Next, we’ll turn our attention to the variable types of our predictors. Because we plan to train a classifiaction model, we know that predictors will ultimately need to be numeric, as opposed to factor variables. In other words, there may be a difference in how we store our data (in factors inside a data frame), and how the underlying equations require them (a purely numeric matrix). 15.1.2 Dummy variables For factors like dest and origin, standard practice is to convert them into dummy or indicator variables to make them numeric. These are binary values for each level of the factor. For example, our origin variable has values of “EWR”, “JFK”, and “LGA”. The standard dummy variable encoding, shown below, will create two numeric columns of the data that are 1 when the originating airport is “JFK” or “LGA” and zero otherwise, respectively. ORIGIN ORIGIN_JFK ORIGIN_LGA EWR 0 0 JFK 1 0 LGA 0 1 But, unlike the standard model formula methods in R, a recipe does not automatically create these dummy variables for you; you’ll need to tell your recipe to add this step. This is for two reasons. First, many models do not require numeric predictors, so dummy variables may not always be preferred. Second, recipes can also be used for purposes outside of modeling, where non-dummy versions of the variables may work better. For example, you may want to make a table or a plot with a variable as a single factor. For those reasons, you need to explicitly tell recipes to create dummy variables using step_dummy(): flights_rec &lt;- recipe(arr_delay ~ ., data = train_data ) %&gt;% update_role(flight, time_hour, new_role = &quot;ID&quot; ) %&gt;% step_date(date, features = c(&quot;dow&quot;, &quot;month&quot;) ) %&gt;% step_holiday(date, holidays = timeDate::listHolidays(&quot;US&quot;) ) %&gt;% step_rm(date) %&gt;% step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) Here, we did something different than before: instead of applying a step to an individual variable, we used selectors to apply this recipe step to several variables at once. The first selector, all_nominal(), selects all variables that are either factors or characters. The second selector, -all_outcomes() removes any outcome variables from this recipe step. With these two selectors together, our recipe step above translates to: Create dummy variables for all of the factor or character columns unless they are outcomes. At this stage in the recipe, this step selects the origin, dest, and carrier variables. It also includes two new variables, date_dow and date_month, that were created by the earlier step_date(). More generally, the recipe selectors mean that you don’t always have to apply steps to individual variables one at a time. Since a recipe knows the variable type and role of each column, they can also be selected (or dropped) using this information. 15.1.3 Zero variance Note that since carrier and dest have some infrequently occurring values, it is possible that dummy variables might be created for values that don’t exist in the training set. For example, there could be destinations that are only in the test set. The function anti_join() returns all rows from x (test_data) where there are not matching values in y (train_data), keeping just columns from x.: test_data %&gt;% distinct(dest) %&gt;% anti_join(train_data) When the recipe is applied to the training set, a column could contain only zeros. This is a “zero-variance predictor” that has no information within the column. While some R functions will not produce an error for such predictors, it usually causes warnings and other issues. step_zv() will remove columns from the data when the training set data have a single value, so it is added to the recipe after step_dummy(): flights_rec &lt;- recipe(arr_delay ~ ., data = train_data ) %&gt;% update_role(flight, time_hour, new_role = &quot;ID&quot; ) %&gt;% step_date(date, features = c(&quot;dow&quot;, &quot;month&quot;) ) %&gt;% step_holiday(date, holidays = timeDate::listHolidays(&quot;US&quot;) ) %&gt;% step_rm(date) %&gt;% step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %&gt;% step_zv(all_predictors()) 15.1.4 Correlations As a final step, we remove predictor variables that have large absolute correlations with other variables flights_rec &lt;- recipe(arr_delay ~ ., data = train_data ) %&gt;% update_role(flight, time_hour, new_role = &quot;ID&quot; ) %&gt;% step_date(date, features = c(&quot;dow&quot;, &quot;month&quot;) ) %&gt;% step_holiday(date, holidays = timeDate::listHolidays(&quot;US&quot;) ) %&gt;% step_rm(date) %&gt;% step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %&gt;% step_zv(all_predictors()) %&gt;% step_corr(all_predictors()) Now we’ve created a specification of what should be done with the data.

We will: Process the recipe using the training set: This involves any estimation or calculations based on the training set. For our recipe, the training set will be used to determine which predictors should be converted to dummy variables and which predictors will have zero-variance in the training set, and should be slated for removal. Apply the recipe to the training set: We create the final predictor set on the training set. Apply the recipe to the test set: We create the final predictor set on the test set. Nothing is recomputed and no information from the test set is used here; the dummy variable and zero-variance results from the training set are applied to the test set. To simplify this process, we can use a model workflow, which pairs a model and recipe together. This is a straightforward approach because different recipes are often needed for different models, so when a model and recipe are bundled, it becomes easier to train and test workflows. We’ll use the workflow package from tidymodels to bundle our parsnip model (lr_mod etc.) with our recipe (flights_rec). 17.1 Fit models with workflows To combine the data preparation with the model building, we use the package workflows. A workflow is an object that can bundle together your pre-processing, modeling, and post-processing requests. 17.1.1 Logistic regression flights_wflow_lr_mod &lt;- workflow() %&gt;% add_model(lr_mod) %&gt;% add_recipe(flights_rec) flights_wflow_lr_mod 17.1.2 Decision tree flights_wflow_dt_mod &lt;- workflow() %&gt;% add_model(dt_mod) %&gt;% add_recipe(flights_rec) flights_wflow_dt_mod 17.1.3 Random forest flights_wflow_rf_mod &lt;- workflow() %&gt;% add_model(rf_mod) %&gt;% add_recipe(flights_rec) flights_wflow_rf_mod 17.1.4 XGBoost flights_wflow_xgb_mod &lt;- workflow() %&gt;% add_model(xgb_mod) %&gt;% add_recipe(flights_rec) flights_wflow_xgb_mod 17.2 Train models Now, there is a single function that can be used to prepare the recipe and train the models from the resulting predictors. 17.2.1 Logistic regression flights_fit_lr_mode &lt;- flights_wflow_lr_mod %&gt;% fit(data = train_data) flights_fit_lr_mode 17.2.2 Decision tree flights_fit_dt_mode &lt;- flights_wflow_dt_mod %&gt;% fit(data = train_data) flights_fit_dt_mode 17.2.3 Random forest flights_fit_rf_mode &lt;- flights_wflow_rf_mod %&gt;% fit(data = train_data) flights_fit_rf_mode 17.2.4 XG Boost flights_fit_xgb_mode &lt;- flights_wflow_xgb_mod %&gt;% fit(data = train_data) flights_fit_xgb_mode 17.3 Model recipe objects The objects above have the finalized recipe and fitted model objects inside. You may want to extract the model or recipe objects from the workflow. To do this, you can use the helper functions pull_workflow_fit() and pull_workflow_prepped_recipe(). For example, here we pull the fitted model object then use the broom::tidy() function to get a tidy tibble of the Logisitc Regression model coefficients. 17.3.1 Logistic regression flights_fit_lr_mode %&gt;% pull_workflow_fit() %&gt;% tidy() 17.3.2 Decision tree flights_fit_xgb_mode %&gt;% pull_workflow_prepped_recipe() 17.3.3 Random forest flights_fit_rf_mode %&gt;% pull_workflow_prepped_recipe() 17.3.4 XG Boost flights_fit_xgb_mode %&gt;% pull_workflow_prepped_recipe() 17.4 Summary Our goal was to predict whether a plane arrives more than 30 minutes late. We have just: Built the model (lr_mod etc.), Created a preprocessing recipe (flights_rec), Bundled the model and recipe (flights_wflow), and Trained our workflow using a single call to fit(). The next step is to use the trained workflow (flights_fit) to predict with the unseen test data, which we will do with a single call to predict(). "],["prediction.html", "Chapter 18 Prediction 18.1 Logistic regression", " Chapter 18 Prediction The predict() method applies the recipe to the new data, then passes them to the fitted model. Let`s use the logistic regression model as an example for the next steps. 18.1 Logistic regression predict( flights_fit_lr_mode, test_data ) Because our outcome variable here is a factor, the output from predict() returns the predicted class: late versus on_time. But, let’s say we want the predicted class probabilities for each flight instead. To return those, we can specify type = \"prob\" when we use predict(). We’ll also bind the output with some variables from the test data and save them together: flights_pred_lr_mod &lt;- predict(flights_fit_lr_mode, test_data, type = &quot;prob&quot; ) %&gt;% bind_cols(test_data %&gt;% select( arr_delay, time_hour, flight )) The data look like: head(flights_pred_lr_mod) Now that we have a tibble with our predicted class probabilities, how will we evaluate the performance of our workflow? We would like to calculate a metric that tells how well our model predicted late arrivals, compared to the true status of our outcome variable, arr_delay. 18.1.1 ROC curve Let’s use the area under the ROC curve as our metric, computed using roc_curve() and roc_auc() from the yardstick package. To generate a ROC curve, we need the predicted class probabilities for late and on_time, which we just calculated in the code chunk above. We can create the ROC curve with these values, using roc_curve() and then piping to the autoplot() method: flights_pred_lr_mod %&gt;% roc_curve( truth = arr_delay, .pred_late ) %&gt;% autoplot() 18.1.2 AUC Similarly, roc_auc() estimates the area under the curve: flights_pred_lr_mod %&gt;% roc_auc(truth = arr_delay, .pred_late) 18.1.3 Accuracy We use the metrics() function to measure the performance of the model. It will automatically choose metrics appropriate for a given type of model. The function expects a tibble that contains the actual results (truth) and what the model predicted (estimate). flights_fit_lr_mode %&gt;% predict(test_data) %&gt;% bind_cols(test_data) %&gt;% metrics( truth = arr_delay, estimate = .pred_class ) 18.1.4 Recall flights_fit_lr_mode %&gt;% predict(test_data) %&gt;% bind_cols(test_data) %&gt;% recall( truth = arr_delay, estimate = .pred_class ) 18.1.5 Precision flights_fit_lr_mode %&gt;% predict(test_data) %&gt;% bind_cols(test_data) %&gt;% precision( truth = arr_delay, estimate = .pred_class ) "],["references.html", "References", " References Géron, Aurélien. 2019.
